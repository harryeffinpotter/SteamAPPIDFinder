# SteamAPPIDFinder
Steam APPID Finder with multiple one-click copy & close (copy the APPID then close the app automatically) options.

I created Steam APPID Finder to interface with my SteamAutoCrack mod, which can be found in my SACM repo. It is made with 2 key feautres in mind.
- Accepts CLI arguments.
- Has multiple ways to copy APPID then close itself.

Contributions welcome!
